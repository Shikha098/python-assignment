        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and related methods into objects. This helps ensure data integrity and prevents unauthorized access.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance:\n",

        "\n",
        "Polymorphism:\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This provides a single interface to represent multiple underlying forms.\n",
