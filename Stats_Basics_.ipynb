The mean is the average of all values and is best used with continuous data that is normally distributed, like average test scores. The median is the middle value when data is ordered, useful for skewed data or when there are outliers, such as household income. The mode is the most frequent value, ideal for categorical data, like the most popular shoe size in a store. Choosing the right measure depends on the data type and distribution."

Variance measures the average squared difference between each data point and the mean, giving an idea of overall spread. However, since variance is in squared units, standard deviation (the square root of variance) is more commonly used because it is in the same units as the original data. Both help understand how much the data varies around the mean."
